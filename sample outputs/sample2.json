Practically, a complete school holds the physical education class, or I dont know what they are doing during school time, there is always a class of children who sweat all over, never use a towel, leave the weights where they just went and sit down in front of a machine where they talk on the phone for half an hour!!  The place became unpleasant!!  There are always more trainers downstairs, why dont they hire them??  It works like this in every normal place!!  Apart from me, I know 4 other people who go to another room for this reason....",
